# LumenKey - Password Generator

Tired of using "password123" for everything? **LumenKey** is your new password generator, focusing on security, speed, and a design you'll actually enjoy using.

No more weak or repeated passwords. LumenKey creates complex, random passwords that protect your accounts from breaches, all wrapped in a clean, modern interface.

### ✨ New in Version 2.2

- **Time to Crack Estimator**: See exactly how strong your password is with real-time entropy analysis (e.g., "Centuries" vs "Instant").
- **Password History**: Access your last 10 generated passwords so you never lose one by accident.
- **Smart Auto-Copy**: Option to automatically copy new passwords to your clipboard for a faster workflow.
- **Enhanced Readability**: New "Exclude Similar Characters" option (removes l, 1, I, O, 0) to prevent confusion.
- **Regenerate Button**: Instantly refresh your password with a single click.

### 🌟 Why Install LumenKey?

- **One-Click Security**: The flagship feature. Right-click any form field (like password or text) and select "Generate with LumenKey" to instantly fill a strong password.
- **Stunning Design**: Inspired by Notion's minimalism and Spotify's dark themes, LumenKey features beautiful Light and Dark ("Lumen") modes that adapt to your preference.
- **Total Control**: Pop open the extension to customize your passwords. Adjust the length (up to 50 characters), choose character types, and now toggle readability or auto-copy settings.
- **Fast & Lightweight**: No bloat, no trackers. Just one tool that does its job perfectly.

### 🔒 Your Privacy is the Priority

LumenKey operates **100% locally** on your browser. Your password settings and theme preferences are saved only on your device. We do not collect, track, or have access to absolutely any of your data. Period.

Stop thinking about passwords. Let LumenKey handle security for you.
